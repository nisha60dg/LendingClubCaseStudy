# General Information
The primary objective is to analyze loan applicant data and determine the factors that influence loan defaults, allowing the company to:
- Reduce financial losses by identifying risky applicants.
- Improve loan approval decisions.
- Understand the drivers behind loan defaults using EDA.


# ðŸ“Š **Analysis Overview**
### 1. **Business Understanding**
The company faces two primary risks:
- Approving loans for applicants likely to default, causing financial loss.
- Rejecting loans for applicants likely to repay, causing missed business opportunities.

### 2. **Data Exploration**
- The dataset contains various applicant-level features such as loan amount, purpose, term, interest rates, and repayment status.
- Key focus areas include:
  - Univariate Analysis
  - Bivariate Analysis
  - Risk Segmentation

### 3. **Insights**
#### Loan Status Distribution:
- Most loans are "Fully Paid."
- Significant defaults are observed in "Charged Off" loans.

#### Default Trends by Loan Term:
- Short-term loans (36 months) have lower default rates.
- Long-term loans (60 months) are riskier.

#### Interest Rate Analysis:
- Defaulters tend to have higher interest rates.

#### Loan Purpose Insights:
- Loans for debt consolidation and small businesses exhibit higher default rates.
